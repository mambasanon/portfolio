## Execution

I led the team through the planning, development, and implementation stages, ensuring each CRM setup was optimized for its specific team. For the outside sales team, the CRM was tailored to enhance mobility and access to real-time data. The inside sales team's CRM was configured to better manage leads and automate follow-ups, reducing manual entry and allowing more time for customer interactions. Significant efforts were also made to automate the equipment shipping process after identifying it as a bottleneck through customer feedback.
